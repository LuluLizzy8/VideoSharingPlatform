General Introduction + Purpose
In this project, we outline the plan to develop a YouTube clone using a full-stack approach with Spring Boot and Angular. It aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular video-sharing platform to provide a platform for users to upload and view video content. It will offer features such as user authentication, uploading, liking videos, view history, and video playback functionality. This project will serve as a practical endeavor to apply software engineering principles in building a complex web application.

Here is a starting-from-zero (step-by-step) guide for setting up the environment:

More installations:
npm install @videogular/ngx-videogular --save
npm install @types/core-js --save-dev

****Special Notes for Mac Users, if not successful after following the guide:***
1. First, check if you give full-disk access to Eclipse:
Go to your mac System Settings >> Privacy & Security >> Full Disk Access >> See if Eclipse is enabled
2. If it is still not working, you need to adjust your path to Maven in Eclipse.
Here is a sample command if you used homebrew to download maven: export=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH (you need to run this whenever you restart the terminal in Eclipse)
