General Introduction:
In this project, we outline the plan to develop a YouTube clone using a full-stack approach with Spring Boot and Angular. It aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular video-sharing platform to provide a platform for users to upload and view video content. It will offer features such as user authentication, uploading, liking videos, subscription, view history, and video playback functionality. This project will serve as a practical endeavor to apply software engineering principles in building a complex web application.

Here is a starting-from-zero (step-by-step) guide for setting up the environment:
