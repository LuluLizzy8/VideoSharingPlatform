April 13
Meet with TA Wang for help.
Resolve the problem of setting up our environment. The problem for MacOS was we didn’t grant Eclipse accessibility to our local files and dependency problems where we needed to build the frontend first and then the backend because the frontend is connected to the backend. If we run backend first, eclipse can’t recoginze frontend. For Viana’s laptop, there was a language server issue which was resolved by force downloading the files. 
Elizabeth: Uploaded backend Video and Comment class to Git; wrote VideoController class, AWSService class, FileService interface; created AWS account, bucket, and passkey; added AWS S3 dependencies to backend pom.xml and updated application.properties file to include AWS S3; debugged, figuring out correct dependencies and formatting until YoutubeCloneApplication.java ran without errors
Lunjia: Writing VideoService class of backend
Viana: Writing user class of backend
Smile: Writing user class of backend

April 25
Elizabeth: Angular upload video to AW3, updated lombok related constructors to fix bug, debugged and recreated the frontend angular application to include the needed and correct files, debugged to resolve the 403 error related to unauthorized access to file upload, debugged and fixed css and ts errors related to header component and save-video-details component, added angular theme to angular.json
Lunjia: Worked on tags and upload thumbnail, save video to database.
Viana: Created header component, save-video details component, video thumbnail function, rebased github and deleted faulty push from repository
